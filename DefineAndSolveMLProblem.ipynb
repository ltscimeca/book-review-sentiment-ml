    "To evaluate my sentiment analysis model, I used Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization on the cleaned review text. After experimenting with different parameters, I found that using n-grams up to trigrams (ngram_range=(1,3)) and filtering out very rare terms with min_df=4 produced the best results. This version achieved an accuracy of 88% with balanced precision and recall for both positive and negative classes. The confusion matrix confirmed that the model made relatively few classification errors. These results suggest that simple preprocessing and feature engineering choices can significantly improve model performance, even with a straightforward linear model like Logistic Regression."
